#### Cleaning data from Tormarket
On the DNM archives site (https://archive.org/download/dnmarchives), download the tormarket.tar.xz and extract. The cleaning code will extract data from the HTML files in the Products folder of this directory. There's more data than can be extracted from these files if we want.

While each market scrape will be different, I imagine we can modify this code slightly and creat functions specific to the data we want for each market.
