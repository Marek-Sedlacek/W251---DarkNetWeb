##Loading Data

#### 00) Exploratory Steps
Before attempting to load any data, we first needed to explore the files we had to determine what information might be useful and the best method to extract it. These files could be considered working files or notes. Ultimately they were not used in the loading of the data, but were necessary to understand the information.

#### 01) Cassandra DB Creation
Script to create our Cassandr Keyspace, as well as the 3 tables we would use for the storage of our data.

#### 02) Load Data
Scripts to read through the HTML files from the raw data, extract the relevant features, and load them to Cassandra.
